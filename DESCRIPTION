Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Eric", "Burden", email = "eric.w.burden@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description:
  This is a template package to demonstrate how to call Rust from R using the 
  'extendr-api' crate. This package is based on the example provided by the
  extendr project at https://github.com/extendr/helloextendr. This package
  includes a number of examples of passing R vectors to Rust and receiving
  back modified values. Where deemed necessary, additional modifications are 
  made to input/output values by wrapping the extendr-generated functions on
  the R side.
