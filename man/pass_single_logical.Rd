\title{Flips a logical value in Rust}
\usage{
pass_single_logical(b)
}
\arguments{
\item{b}{A logical (boolean) value to treat as a bool in Rust}
}
\value{
!b
}
\description{
Demonstrates passing a logical (boolean) value back and forth between R and
Rust, flipping the value in Rust to prove it works.
}
\details{
The value passed to this function must be a logical, the boolean type in
R, or an NA (plain NA is logical). The Rust function signature is
\verb{fn pass_single_logical_fn(b: Option<bool>) -> Option<bool>}, with
NA's being handled as \code{None} in Rust.
}
\examples{
pass_single_logical(TRUE)  # FALSE
pass_single_logical(NA)    # NA

}
